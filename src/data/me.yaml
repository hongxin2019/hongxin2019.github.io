  bio: >
    I am a Ph.D. candidate advised by
    <a class="link" href="http://www.bigdatalab.ac.cn/~lanyanyan/">Yanyan Lan</a>
    at the Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), Chinese Academy of
    Sciences. Currently, I work in the areas of computer vision and machine
    learning with focus on visual reasoning, and joint processing of
    text and image data.
  interests: >
    I'm interested in computer vision and machine learning. Recently, I also try to apply machine learning techniques into biology problemcs, such as protein structure prediction.
  review_experiences: CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, AAAI, IJCV, JSTSP, Neural Computing and Applications.
